# Test Cases

## Overall behavior

- Two ways to start this extension...
  1. Open any YouTube video link, or
  2. Open other YouTube pages, then navigate to a Youtube video
- Then, all custom UI should be appended, including different "queue points" and "audio effects".
- If no previous state is saved, all states are set to be default.
- else, all states are the same as the latest saved states.

## Queue points

- an additional bar above progress bar with 10 adjustable keypoints.

## Audio effects

- a small panel should be appended.

## Sequencer

- a sequencer interface should be added in the popup page.
